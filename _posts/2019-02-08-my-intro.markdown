Hey there!

My name is Adway Kanhere & welcome to my site.

I have always wanted to write about my life and the things I do, however I'm always procrastinating the work behind it.

This time around, I decided to take writing seriously and plan to keep posting all what I do during my last few semesters of college.

This place will be my portfolio + sketchpad + random posts pad + paper/book discussion platform that will allow me to organize what I do and read and also allow you to look at my work and provide feedback. This is my runaway place to get away from the hustle of undergrad life.

Apart from this this will be a blog of all things (Biomedical) U (CS) U (Maths) U (A few Snaps that I wish to share)

I'm also interested in Data Science and Machine/Deep Learning and will be discussing my views and understandings of a few selected papers and books.

See you next time,
Cheers.
