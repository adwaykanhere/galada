There is a growing need in todays health conscious society to aid in the diagnosis of a persons well being. People are getting more aware about their health and are beginning to use tools to aid their understanding and assessment of their day to day activities.

Companies such as Apple and Samsung have already identified these trends and have created products such as the Apple Smart Watch series 4 that has an inbuilt ECG sensor & the Samsung smartband with an inbuilt heart rate sensor.

Some of the important parameters to monitor during exercise are heart rate, respiratory rate. In addition to this, products such as the Apple watch also provide a health guide and have apps to monitor ones daily routine and give personalized information on how much they exercise. 

One of the techniques that can be used to detect and monitor an individuals activities is Photoplethysmography.

# What is Photoplethysmography?

> Photoplethysmography is a type of plethysmography technique that is used to measure the changes in blood volume with a specialized transducer.

The reason why PPG is still considered relevant is because of the simplicity in  the set up of the apparatus, the convenience in acquiring the signal and it being a cheaper alternative to conventional electrode based methods.

Below is an image that describes how the PPG sensor works:

The amount of blood that the heart pumps during one cardiac cycle is termed as cardiac output. This blood is pumped to all parts of the body.Let's focus on the effect of this pressure on the peripheral arteries. By illuminating the skin surface by an LED and measuring the light transmitted or reflected by a photodiode we can estimate the change in volume due to the pressure wave.

The signal thus obtained is as shown.

In the next post, I will share more on the features of PPG and shed some light on PPG signal processing.

Thanks for staying around :)
