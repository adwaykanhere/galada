Hi There! My name is Adway Kanhere. I'm a Biomedical Undergrad working on Data Science and Machine learning applications in Healthcare. This will be my personal blog where I will upload my notes on any book I find useful, share my project ideas and talk about other cool ML stuff. I hope to keep this short and "not boring" as much as possible.
